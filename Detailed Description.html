								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Aims</h2>
								<p>The aim of our project is to create a fully functioning medical chatbot called PMD. The fully functioning PMD will be integrated with artificial intelligence and machine learning. This will allow it to constantly learn medical symptoms and speech to develop into a chatbot equivalent to a professional medical practitioner. Currently we have limited time, therefore we cannot integrate artificial intelligence or machine learning. However, we have created a few goals to show our project's potential and to reach our aim. The first goal is to create a prototype that will have the potential to diagnose 10 different illnesses. The second goal is to create a landing page to facilitate our chatbot. Third goal is to create graphical designs to enhance the user experience. Finally, create ads to market our chatbot. The above goals are listed according to priority.</p>
								<p>The first goal is to create a prototype by using python. Visual studio will be used to code the chatbot, then we will create a separate discord server to facilitate and run the chatbot. Finally, users can access the service of our chatbot through the server and receive a diagnosis according to the information they communicate to the chatbot. This will be created to showcase the potential of a PMD and its usefulness to the general public.</p>
								<p>The second goal is to create a landing page to make it more accessible to the public and any investors. This page will be a website that can be easily accessed by anyone with basic IT knowledge to diagnose themselves easily. Its main purpose is to provide accessibility to all users that need a quick diagnosis, with the minimum requirements possible.</p>
								<p>The third goal is to create graphical designs to enhance and provide a more entertaining user experience. As it is a very mechanical process, unlike a visit to the doctor, it will need a more aesthetic view to create a more friendly interaction between the user and PMD.  Another reason is to show uniqueness and set it apart from other chatbots. </p>
								<p>Finally, our chatbot will need to be promoted to the public. For this we will create google advertisements that will be able to reach our target consumer market and provide them with the services of PMD. The advertisements might also help us to gain any interested individuals that might help us to reach our final aim. </p>
								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Plans and Progress</h2>
								<p>The PMD chatbot, short for Pre-Medical Diagnosis chatbot, is designed to give users a chance to figure out what their medical diagnosis will be prior to attending an appointment with their General Practitioner (GP) - hence, the "Pre" part of the name.</p>
								<p>Indeed, the idea for the PMD chatbot began with using IBM Watson to create an AI chatbot medical chatbot that could diagnose 30-40 illnesses, and this idea evolved into a discord python chatbot prototype due to our limited knowledge of how to create such an advanced chatbot and the limited timeframe in which we could create the PMD prototype.</p>
								<p>This project is targeted towards a relatively young demographic, ranging from teenagers to young adults, and aims to spark interest in how a medical diagnosis works (eg. The chatbot conversation with the user mirrors how a GP would be asking about symptoms that the patient is experiencing in order to narrow down the potential disease that the patient is experiencing), and therefore, get young people intrigued about the field of medicine and becoming a doctor. </p>
								<p>The PMD chatbot was created using the current version of Python (Python 3.10) and its libraries, as well as Microsoft Studio code editor, to edit the chatbot's code. Discord.py (the primary library for creating and modifying the PMD chatbot) and the extensions installed to help code the PMD chatbot easier included: the Material Icon Theme by Philip Kief, Python v2022.16.0 by Microsoft and Pylance v2022.10.10 by Microsoft. </p>
								<p>Additionally, we used our knowledge of HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to create the PMD chatbot advertisement and information website - and; this website directed users to the discord server where the PMD chatbot was operating and also where users could read up on information about the PMD chatbot.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, the testing for the PMD chatbot was done through three separate public chats on a discord server in order to determine if the chatbot was able to continue responding to test user inputs - the test users were the people in our group. Each time a medical diagnosis (in other words, a new physical illness was added to the chatbot) was added to the code of the PMD chatbot, we tested how the chatbot would respond to user inputs to prevent the risk of us missing any bugs, and to isolate where potential errors were coming from. Some of the issues that we encountered included: when the PMD chatbot was unable to connect to the discord server and therefore did not reply to the user input; and overloading potentially occurring if user commands were entered into the public chats simultaneously, as this would have caused the chatbot to simply shut down.</p>

								<p>As such, this was our following timeframe for this project:</p>
								
								<p>In the first week that we were given to create our project, the PMD chatbot, from the 26th of September to the 2nd of October, we spent finishing up Assignment 2's group contribution feedback forms.</p> 
								
								<p>The second week of the PMD chatbot creation, from the 3rd to the 9th of October, we spent working on writing the landscape, roles, aims, motivation, group communications, topic, skills and jobs, scope and limitations, testing and the tools and technologies parts of the report; researching diseases and their respective symptoms to include in the PMD chatbot prototype; creating the graphic design for the PMD chatbot advertisements (on the PMD discord chatbot information website) and for the discord server that would contain the PMD chatbot; creating a separate discord server for the PMD prototype chatbot to operate off of; and finishing off the customisation of the PMD chatbot.</p>
								
								<p>Then, from the 10th to the 16th of October (the third week in the PMD chatbot creation), we spent writing the time frame, scope and limitations, skills and jobs, testing, bibliography (and in-text references), tools and technologies, risks, and roles parts of the report; creating the graphic design for the PMD chatbot advertisements (on the PMD discord chatbot information website) and for the discord server that would contain the PMD chatbot; creating a separate discord server for the PMD prototype chatbot to operate off of; and researching diseases and their respective symptoms to include in the PMD chatbot prototype. </p>
								
								<p>Finally, in the fourth and last week of the PMD chatbot creation, from the 17th to the 23rd of October, we spent finishing off the timeframe table, plans and progress, group reflection, bibliography (and in-text references), and the plans and progress parts of this report; adding images to the report; editing the final version of the report before turning into a pdf for submission (for assessment), and transferring everything from the final version of the report onto a second GitHub website. </p>

								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">SCOPE AND LIMITS</h2>
								<p>Limitations of our project include time, budget, resources and skills needed to achieve our bots full potential. To remedy this our scope is drastically reduced to its current form today. Though we would like to incorporate machine learning capabilities and a vast database of illness and diagnoses, we have limited ourselves to produce a discord chatbot; a platform which we are as a group familiar with and relatively interested in working with. </p>
								<p>Initially we had wanted to create a fully functional chatbot that offers pre medical diagnoses to users; pulling from a vast database of illnesses and symptoms. We had also wanted to create a functioning website and redirection functions to the bot, utilising google ads, maps and suggestions to further direct users to GPs and certified medical practitioners after receiving their PMD.</p>
								<p>Further quality of life components we also wanted to include were dedicated UI and application platforms for our bot, certification and approval to provide our service to the public as well as other such locale settings to allow accessibility for a more global audience. </p>
								<p>Time also plays a large role in limiting our scope for this project, as we are given roughly 10 weeks to conceptualise and produce our outcome. With roughly four to five weeks to further flesh out and develop our original prototype. Our group members have also had to balance commitments between work, life and other assignments alongside this project, which was considered heavily when organising meetings, goals and expectations moving forward. </p>
								<p>Currently the chatbot is fully functional and is a valid proof of concept as it is capable of diagnosing up to ten diseases with over 20 unique symptoms. 

								Although we planned to implement a working AI to assist patients with realistic conversations. We concluded that the algorithm approach would be more realistic as once again the AI wouldn't be possible to implement within the 10 weeks timeframe provided. 
								
								With further funds and time provided, we will be able to implement upgrades such as a wide range of diseases, UI update, mobile application, Approval from multiple countries, etc.</p>
								
								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
								<p>For the PMD medical chatbot, we will be using Python 3.10 (The most up-to-date version) and its libraries. We are using this version as the discord bot only works for Python 3.8+ and allows us to access the newest libraries. We will use the Microsoft visual studio code editor to code with Python. There isn’t any particular reason we are using visual studio, but most of us have used the code editor in previous classes. Alongside using Visual Studio, we will be using the following extensions to make our coding experience better: Python v2022.16.0 by Microsoft, Pylance v2022.10.10 by Microsoft and Material Icon Theme by Philip Kief. Once both Python and Visual Studio are ready, we need to install Discord.py. Discord.py is the main library we will be using to create the bot and modify it. Currently, Discord.py is not being updated. However, the library is still available for use and can give the main functionalities to our bot. As our PMD medical chatbot only works on discord, we will be creating a separate discord server revolving around the chatbot. Knowledge of how to set up the discord server and create various chat channels for disclaimers, assistance etc., will be needed. After creating the bot, we will be creating a website that will require knowledge of Bootstrap, CSS and HTML. This website will be the main location where our target users can see and visit our discord server. Our group member Jazmin will create several banners and icons for the landing page and discord server. She will be using photoshop by adobe to create the images and will be using her IPAD to draw designs. For our new medical chatbot website, we will be using Google Ads to advertise our website. Search ads and display advertisements will be created for the website to help promote our bot. </p>
								<p>Each of our members has knowledge of Python through previous courses. However, we don’t have advanced experience using Python. This will make it harder for us to create a more sophisticated design for the bot and will require us to watch youtube videos. Each member has watched videos on the discord.py library and has a basic knowledge of creating the bot. For creating the Google Ads advertisements and discord website, Emre and Jazmin will be the major participants. Emre has experience using the Google Ads platform and creating websites, whilst Jazmin knows about creating designs for websites and ads. </p>
								
								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Testing</h2>
								<p>We have begun doing tests for our PMD medical chatbot through our discord server. On our discord server, we designated three separate chats to see if the bot would continue responding to our user inputs. These tests are conducted by our members each time a new diagnosis is added through our code to ensure we have no errors. The bot has had moments where it couldn’t connect to the server properly and did not respond to the command. By conducting these tests, we were able to determine where the issue had happened and fixed it accordingly. Testing will be spread out to other servers rather than our own to see if the bot will continue working despite receiving commands from different servers. Overloading may occur with the bot if commands are sent through at the same time and cause the bot to shutdown. Hence why users from different servers need to send out commands to us for us to see if we can handle the load.</p>

								<p>Additionally, the information below was the data that was included in the PMD chatbot:</p>
								<p>Hand foot and mouth disease (Queensland Government 2020):</p>
								<p>Symptoms:</p>
								<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

									<li>First Item</li>
									<li>A red rash appearing on the person’s palms (without itching) but the person might sometimes experience blistering soles and sometimes the buttocks (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
									<li>Headache (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
									<li>Malaise (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
									<li>Sore throat (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
									<li>Infants and toddlers with this disease may
									experience irritability (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
									<li>Poor sense of appetite (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
									<li>Fever (Dr. Mehrotra n.d.)</li>
															
								</ul>

								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Risks</h2>
								<p>After discussing with a medical professional, a risk that was identified with this chatbot was the potential ethical issues with getting a diagnosis from a chatbot instead of a human doctor, as they felt that a doctor chatbot would be unable to replace the experience and knowledge of a human doctor. </p>
								<p>The doctor also pointed out that a patient's medical history (e.g. allergies, asthma, family's medical history, etc.) is also important for diagnosis and that mental health issues also may influence the onset of the physical disease - and since we do not have a way of ensuring that the chatbot has a strong level of cybersecurity, we decided not to include the chatbot asking for and recording a patient's medical history for a diagnosis because we do not want to face the ethical and legal consequences if their personal data is leaked. </p>
								<p>In addition, we also decided not to include the diagnosis of mental health issues because our chatbot would not be able to have the human empathy and experience to achieve it. Which would make it incapable of providing a mental health diagnosis to a patient and, therefore, may treat the patient insensitively. </p>
								<p>For example, it was discovered in 2018 that the chatbot Woebot was incapable of ethically responding to reports of child sexual abuse because when BBC tried to test the Woebot by inputting the line "I'm being forced to have sex, and I'm only 12 years old", Woebot responded with "Sorry you're going through this, but it also shows me how much you care about connexion and that's really kind of beautiful." (White 2018). </p>
								<p>Further, when BBC tried to test other therapist chatbots on how they would respond to reports of eating disorders, one of the chatbots, Wysa, said, "It's always nice to learn more about you and what makes you happy." "After the BBC tester responded "throwing up" to a previous Wysa question about what they were looking forward to for the day (White 2018). BBC also found that when the Woebot received the tester's input that they were smoking drugs and that they thought it was illegal but ultimately fine in the end, Wysa would respond, "Nice job!" (White 2018). </p>
								<p>Hence, we did not include the chatbot asking about a patient's mental health and including that in the diagnosis of a physical illness, which meant that the chatbot was not capable of providing a full diagnosis of the physical illness, and what may have helped cause it - and also because the chatbot does not have a strong level of cybersecurity that would otherwise ensure that extremely sensitive medical data, such a patient's mental health issues, is not leaked. </p>
								<p>Furthermore, while therapists' chatbots are currently being used, there is a scarcity of research on how effective they actually are - and the research that is present is done by the companies who created these chatbots in the first place, therefore resulting in the high risk of this research being potentially biased (Browne, 2022). </p>
								<p>Additionally, since there is currently barely any government regulation over mental health apps, this means that current therapist chatbots can essentially mislead patients over how competent they will be in providing them mental health treatment - which could result in the patient fully trusting in a therapist chatbot, even if it gives them inadequate treatment, and therefore is another legal and ethical risk that we wanted to avoid with our chatbot (Browne, 2022).</p>
								<p>lso, the researcher Estelle Smith (2022) discovered that the therapist chatbot Woebot would congratulate the user for "taking care of their mental and physical health" when she tested how it would respond to suicidality in a patient - which therefore puts into question the competency of therapist chatbots pertaining to their ability to treat patients (Browne, 2022) effectively.</p>
								<p>In addition, an NBCI review (2020) says that while chatbots do "have the potential to improve mental health", the research on this matter has contradictory results, and the Texas University professor of medical humanities and philosophy Tekin (n.d.) says that therapist chatbot "creat[e] the illusion of help" all point to the current technology available not being sophisticated enough to make proper therapist chatbots, we decided not to include a therapy element with our chatbot, and therefore not risk a patient's mental health with a medical chatbot unable to give them sufficient treatment (Browne, 2022). </p>
								<p>Furthermore, including mental health diagnosis as a part of the medical chatbot means that an age limit would need to be imposed on the users of the medical chatbot, which renders the main purpose of this chatbot (being usable for kids, and gaining their interest in a simplified representation of how medical diagnosis works, and therefore gain their interest in medicine) useless because then the chatbot would be primarily used by adults.</p>
								<p>Additionally, some symptoms are visual (eg. extreme redness in the face or any other body part). Since the chatbot does not have eyes, it cannot see what the patient's visual symptoms look like (as a patient may overlook some visual symptoms) because chatbots cannot yet make use of the camera on the device that the chatbot is being used on -. In contrast, human doctors are able to see any visible symptoms of certain illnesses that the patient may have overlooked or dismissed as unimportant. Also, even if chatbots did become sophisticated enough to be able to access the camera on the device (that the person is using the chatbot on), the potentially poor lighting conditions or quality of the camera could affect how clear the picture is, and therefore how accurately the chatbot would be able to diagnose the patient off of the visual symptom shown in the photo.</p>
								<p>Ultimately, to avoid further ethical and legal consequences, we decided to circumvent this risk by including disclaimers that the PMD chatbot is not a replacement for an actual human doctor because it cannot diagnose mental health issues or ask about the patient's medical history, or provide prescribed medicine for the patient to use, this means that the PMD chatbot cannot provide a full diagnosis and therefore proper treatment for the patient - and that after every diagnosis that chatbot gives a patient, there will be a line stating that they should still go and see their GP afterwards because the medical chatbot is not a replacement for the experience, knowledge and empathy of a human doctor. This would therefore prevent the risk of the patient being given misleading information about the actual competency of the PMD chatbot about how it can replace it.</p>
								<p>Moreover, another function of our chatbot is that it can help patients find a GP that is close to them by providing a link to another website (not made by us) that helps the patient find a GP by typing in their location. Additionally, the chatbot can also help a patient arrange an appointment with a GP by including a link to another website (not made by us) that helps a patient arrange an appointment with a GP. This, therefore, prevents the risk of their personal data (e.g. their home address and medical history) being stolen or leaked, as the chatbot would not be asking after and recording such sensitive information.</p>
								<p>Another major risk and concern is user privacy. A doctor's visit is very personal as it involves communicating about issues that an individual will not feel comfortable sharing with others. Therefore, choosing to share with an artificial entity will pose another level of difficulty. However, with the development and evolution of technology, the younger generation is more comfortable communicating with chatbots. Unfortunately, with the development of tech, the higher risk of cybercrimes. Losing user privacy is a major concern and risk to PMD. In order to reduce the risk of cybercrimes, constant upgrades and checks of cybersecurity software will need to be conducted. </p>

								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Group processes and communications</h2>
								<p>Communication between our members has been going exceptionally well, and everyone has responded regularly, starting from assignment 2. We used Discord and Microsoft Teams to communicate effectively with each other and ensure each member was updated. Discord was super helpful as each member was familiar with it and was more comfortable using the platform. Here, we made regular announcements on what we needed to do for the assignment and had casual talks to help build a better team spirit. However, we didn’t use discord to make voice calls and instead used Microsoft Teams. Microsoft teams were utilised whenever we had a meeting take place. Our group member Carissa regularly set up meeting reminders through teams, which helped a lot in having members join the meetings. The meeting frequency was a minimum of 2 per week and set place in the afternoon. These meetings were crucial as they helped each member understand their dedicated tasks for the week; concerns and issues the group members had were considered, and team consensus was achieved. Hence, our group communication process was smooth and didn’t lead to many conflicts. </p>
