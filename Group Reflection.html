								<p>The group was very active and communicative throughout the assignments. Regular meetings were held, which helped us discuss our concerns and allocate tasks for the next meeting. In regard to improvement, the group could have had real-life meetings. These real-life meetings would have been better for building connections between members and overall improving the team relationship. One thing I learned about groups was how important it is to use each member's skills and traits to brainstorm ideas. By incorporating each member's knowledge, we were able to come up with various artefacts for the assignment.</p>

								<p>Our group was very good at communication, scheduling regular meetings in order to ensure all of the target goals were completed, and delegating tasks and roles for each team member. However, the things that could be improved would be everyone working on transferring everything from the report onto the GitHub repository so that there can be a more accurate log of activity. Additionally, one thing that was surprising was how intensive the process is for making an AI powered chatbot, and one thing that I have learned about groups is that communication and scheduling is very important for success.</p>

								<p>We had good team synergy during my time with my group members through Assignments 2 and 3. Each member had unique skills or traits that contributed to creating our artefacts for the assignment. This made doing the assignments much more enjoyable and the process of finishing them easier. Regular schedules of meetings through teams helped members come together more often and are a habit I'll continue doing in future groups. However, the group could improve the way GitHub was used, as it was hard to keep track of what everyone was doing through shared google docs. I have gained valuable knowledge through groups on how to organise team meetings and effectively communicate between members. What surprised me most was how sophisticated creating a python discord bot can be and the many options you can add to the bot.</p>

								<p>For our previous assignment, we communicated and worked well together, however our planning had an issue. However, we implemented a better plan for assignment 3 and improved on our shortcomings. One issue was that we assigned too many goals for the next meeting and so our goals weren't realistic. For assignment two we managed to create smaller goals that we were able to complete before the next meeting. For this assignment our communication was even better than the last assignment. We communicated our ideas more comfortably; meetings were conducted smoothly, and we completed the work without any issue. One thing that was surprising was the speed at which we completed our work. I think it is due to consistent scheduling of meetings and maintaining realistic agenda goals.</p>

								<p>Each group member played a major role towards finishing the assignment with different knowledge, expertise and unique selling points. By sharing these perspectives, we were able to work collaboratively and effectively coexist. Regular meetings were organised and held with a clear objective for each member, and all were able to deliver in a timely manner. Each member's various skill sets also help create artefacts from programming knowledge to design outcomes, as well as industry knowledge. Each member was self-sufficient and effortlessly allocated themselves into sections and roles; without issue and delivered, which was useful. Some areas of improvement would be starting early and getting ourselves organised in a more timely manner, as we have spent most of the first week without progress. Other than that, it was great to be able to work with my group members; they are all very knowledgeable, talented and cordial individuals, and I would love to work alongside them again in the future</p>
								<p style="font-weight:bold;">Group Reflection Together:</p>
								<p>Overall, as a group, the last two assignments have been gratifying. Each of our members came from different backgrounds, like design, IT and information systems. Thanks to the diversity of our majors, we had a ton of options available to us when brainstorming ideas for our prototype and the many artefact options available. Communication was the key success factor in our group and what made the process of finishing the last 2 group assignments smoother. We stuck to Discord and Microsoft teams for our main point of communication, which helped build team synergy and ensure every member was up to date. We could have improved our communication further if face-to-face meetings were possible, as seeing each other in real life would make building team relationships better. Everyone was doing their tasks on time without having to send separate announcements each time a task needed to be completed. This made the progress of finishing our assignment on time possible. We believe one thing we could have improved in the group assignments was the unrealistic goals set in the agenda. Having unrealistic goals set can discourage members and make them rush trying to finish their parts. Leading to lower-quality work and pressure on the members. </p>
