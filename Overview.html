								<h2>Our Topic</h2>
								<p>For this project, we will be creating a medical chatbot by the name PMD. PMD is a discord-only pre-diagnosis chatbot that helps diagnose people based on their symptoms and gives them instructions on what they should do next. We will have several phases in which we design the PMD chatbot and increase the complexity of its diagnosis over time. In the current stage of our prototype, we will be using python to create the bot and will be using the discord.py library. The bot will have several commands that it will respond to based on what symptoms the user is looking to get diagnosed for. Once the user has inputted the command in the discord channel, e.g. !cold, the bot will respond by showing the symptoms. The symptoms will be shown to the user, and the user will need to respond either by pressing "YES" or "NO". The bot will notice the response and give them the diagnosis. Each member of the project will add their own symptom through the shared coding workspace and give the bot more options in its responses. 
								</p>
								<p>Alongside our bot's creation, we will create a separate website that users can access to see our discord bot. The main outcome of this website is for the release of our new medical chatbot; discord server owners that want to add our bot to their own server can request access. We will also add separate pages that explain what our bot is about and a "user manual" that explains what commands they can use. Another artefact we are aiming for with our bot is to create a discord server entirely based on the PMD chatbot. This discord server will be the main hub that users will access and get to use the chatbot to diagnose themselves. This is to ensure we are providing the necessary rules and disclaimers of how the bot works through discord channels. Finally, another artefact we are aiming for is to create Google Ads advertisements using the Google Ads platform to promote our bot. Search ads and Display ads will be deployed for the website, and our team members will create designs for those ads. </p>
								<h2>Motivation </h2>
								<p>The PMD discord python chatbot is important because it could help solve the issue of a shortage in medical staff, enable medical companies to be capable of providing customer service without spending more money on employing and paying human staff (Alan Blog n.d.),  - and it also caters to a younger audience by getting them interested in their health. Our chatbot fits in with the current IT trends of enhanced communication (as it can communicate with a person, much like how chatbots are used to converse with patients to arrange doctor appointments), and of improved mobility (since the chatbot can be used on a website/discord, the sick person will potentially not have to worry as much about needing to travel to go to a doctor) (Rauv 2021).</p>
								<p>Additionally, our chatbot would be a step forward in terms of how chatbots are currently being used in the medical industry (eg. arranging doctor appointments, saving money on potentially unnecessary medical treatments - like preventing unnecessary hospital visits -, providing a patient’s current symptoms as well as previous their medical history from a conversation with a chatbot so that their appointment with the doctor is more time-efficient) (Kalinin 2020). In addition, since it would be implemented on discord, the demographic for the PMD chatbot would be a younger audience - and henceforth the chatbot would get them interested in their health and in potentially becoming a doctor or a part of the health industry. </p>
								<p>Furthermore, the successful completion of this project would demonstrate to a future employer that we have the capability to design and create medical chatbots that encourage the youth to become more interested in the health system.</p>
								<h2>Landscape</h2>
								<p>PMD is a pre medical diagnoses bot similar to existing health chatbots Your.MD, Ada Health, and many others. From assignment 2, frequent comparisons were made to the IBM Watson, a business AI designed for easy use of data from diverse sources. Able to create predictions and recommendations from a suite of  AI models. Designed for efficiency, our chatbot aims to achieve this for healthcare providing pre medical diagnoses to individuals to aid individual health and or care decisions. </p>
								<p>Whilst not entirely replacing GPs and doctors, our bot is designed to accelerate decision making for users in regards to their health and whether they should seek professional care. Your.MD is a Norwegian chatbot that utilizes artificial intelligence to create personalized outcomes regarding the user's health. Designed to answer medical queries ensuring “answered, science-backed, medically-checked.” results to its users. Following a similar ethos is Ada Health which aims to provide symptom assessment and solutions available to the market by access of “vast AI based database” being the service with the most features from other competitors. PMD’s point of difference lies in its platform and medium, solely operating on discord in its own dedicated server. Prior to joining and interacting with the bot users are required to consent to our terms to warn and protect users from potential ethical  issues and dilemmas. </p>
								<p>As users should never make medical decisions without professional opinion, they are required to understand this. Users are also protected from information -breaches as no backlogs are kept from user interaction with the bot, dedicated private channels with tight permissions will be provided to each user. Our terms, rules and regulations will be made transparent to its users and ensure that our service will be free of malice and serve to accelerate health conscious decision making for the audience. The discord platform also allows our service to be available anywhere so long as a stable connection to the internet is established; different locales are also available for non english speakers.</p>
